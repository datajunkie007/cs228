Describe your method used to recognize the unknown actions here.

Start with training a different model for each of the training actions.

Start with obtaining better initial probability estimates for class assignments for the poses.
Use gmdistribution.fit method to find gaussian mixture with K components that best fits data of poses.
The result probability gaussian mixture model is random to some extent.
Needed to do some wrangling to get the clustering to work on 30-dimensional data.
Then use posterior probabilities of which poses are assigned components for initial hidden state probabilities.
Once InitialClassProb are initialized, we initialize InitialPairProb accordingly. We initialize each row of InitialPairProb as the same, representing state transform probability.
Using the EM method to train an HMM.

Then test for each action, by computing likelihood over each of the models.
We compute the likelihood by constructing a clique tree consisting of three types of factors.
The initial state prior, the transition CPDs and the emission CPDs.
Calibrating this clique tree yields the likelihood from the unormalized beliefs after message passing is completed.

We then choose the model with highest likelihood, and state that as our prediction.
